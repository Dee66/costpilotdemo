# Demo Infrastructure

This directory contains Terraform configurations for the demonstration scenario.

**⚠️ DANGER: Do not run `terraform apply` - this will create real AWS resources and incur charges**

These configurations are:
- Used only for generating demo plans and diffs
- Pre-computed outputs are in `snapshots/`
- Designed to demonstrate cost regression scenarios
- Not intended for actual infrastructure deployment

For production infrastructure templates, see the CostPilot product repository.
