    implementation_philosophy: >
      Pragmatic approach: Implement 3 core patterns that solve real problems,
      avoid over-engineering. Additional patterns (Strategy, Adapter, Observer,
      Decorator, Chain of Responsibility) deferred until complexity justifies them.
    
    rationale: >
      For a demo repository, excessive pattern usage adds complexity without
      clear benefit. Focus on patterns that eliminate duplication and improve
      maintainability. Save advanced patterns for when:
      - Noise cases exceed 10+ variants (Strategy)
      - Multiple TF versions needed (Adapter)
      - Plugin architecture required (Observer)
      - Validation becomes conditional (Chain of Responsibility)
