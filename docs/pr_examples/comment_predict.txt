## Prediction Confidence

- **EC2**: 95% (based on on-demand pricing)
- **S3**: 85% (assumes current growth rate continues)
- **CloudWatch**: 90% (based on current log volume)
- **EBS**: 95% (straightforward pricing)

## Cost Drivers

1. **Primary Driver**: EC2 instance type change (87% of increase)
2. **Secondary**: S3 lifecycle removal (8% of increase)
3. **Tertiary**: Log retention + EBS (5% of increase)

**💡 Optimization Opportunities:**
- Revert EC2 to `t3.small` → Save $400/month
- Keep S3 lifecycle enabled → Save $45/month
- Use 30-day log retention → Save $12/month
