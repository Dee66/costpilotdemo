# Demo Output Data

This directory contains pre-generated output data from CostPilot analysis for demonstration purposes.

**⚠️ This is demo data only - not production outputs**

These files are:
- Deterministic and hash-stable
- Used for marketing, documentation, and walkthroughs
- Generated from the controlled scenario in `infrastructure/terraform/`
- Safe to examine but not suitable for real infrastructure analysis

For the actual CostPilot product, see the separate product repository.
